# lunetta-synths
Repository of all the Lunetta Synth Information i can find on the Internet.

Over the Period of time, i will add on to this Folder Guides, Schematics, and other resources that i can get my hands on.
This will really Help in Segregating and Classifying the Information in the Best way possible.

Please mail: shivinboxmail@gmail.com for contribution to the repository. 
They are all most welcome :)

Peace Out.

Happy Tinkering.
